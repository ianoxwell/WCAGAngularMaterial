	<h2>Alert area</h2>
	<p>The basic angular material snackbar although meeting WCAG guideline doesn't provide sufficient flexibility in terms of multiple
		alerts/toasts. PrimeUI's toast design in my opinion allows for multiple alerts as well as significant flexibility of design. The custom components here have been heavily modified

	</p>
	<button mat-flat-button type="button" color="primary" (click)="showMessage()" title="Show alert success message" class="mr-2">Show Alert
		message</button>
	<button mat-flat-button type="button" color="accent" (click)="clearMessages()" title="Show alert success message">Clear Alerts</button>

	<h2>Header Bar</h2>
	<p><strong>Skip to main content</strong> - A needed addition to the page to allow for keyboard users to skip any page navigation elements and get
		immediate focus on the pages title / contents. Page help is included here as the second item. </p>
	<p><strong>Menu</strong> - out of box material adds aria-controls and keyboard interaction to the matMenu item. Little additional configuration is
		needed, beyond giving a specific title to the menu button and the addition of aria-current to the menu-item with the
		routerLinkActive</p>
	<p><strong>Tab navigation</strong> - Angular material theming allows the declaration of a strong focus indicator along with a contrasting color choice.
		However it does not automatically apply the needed mat-focus-indicator to links and the color is
		inconsistent with form-fields. A simple directive covers the additional class to links. Mat-form-field has its own focus class for
		outline that receives the warning color in error state - and a css over-ride</p>
	<p><strong>Switch Theme</strong> - Theme detection pulls from the browsers preference, saving the user's last choice to local storage to remain consistent through
		refreshes. Color Schemes for both light and dark theme meet the minimum of 4.5:1 contrast ratio. Note that the title of the button
		changes to indicate what the button will do on the next (click).</p>

# WCAGAngularMaterial

This project is aimed to test and demonstrate getting some simple pages in a SPA to comply with WCAG 2.1AA standards for web accessibility.\
A demo of the site can be found [WCAG Angular material demonstration](https://ianoxwell.github.io/WCAGAngularMaterial/)

## Axe clean and lighthouse 100%

The aim is to produce a repeatable #axeClean in any state of the app with re-usable components between projects.

## WCAG resources

I prefer going straight to the source and using the w3 produced resources directly./
